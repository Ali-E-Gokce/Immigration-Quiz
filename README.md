# Immigration-Quiz
Quizzes and information about Immigration, Developed for the Earlham Developmental Economics Course.

You can select between two quizzes about immigration policy in the US, EU, and AU. At the end, it tells the user how well 
they did compared to other people, sorted by political affiliation. 

The frontend was inspired by: https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-quiz-tutorial/

I just coded the site, and have not participated in the content generation.
